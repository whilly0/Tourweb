            One of the most popular tourist destinations in Nigeria, Ikogosi Warm Spring is a unique site where warm and cold springs merge, both maintaining their 
            thermal properties. Located in Ekiti State, Ikogosi is situated in a dense forest and extends over a hilly landscape.
            Many stories have been told as regards the history of this site. The most striking of all the tales is that the warm 
            and cold water were wives of a man who, after a long contest, turned into springs through magical means. The troublesome wife became the warm water, while the gentle and peace-loving wife 
            became the cold water. However, it is largely believed that the spring was discovered by a Baptist Missionary in 1950.
            Asides the spectacular waterfall where warm and cold water flow side by side, Ikogosi has a well-designed trail that 
            leads to the meeting point of cold and warm water which is guaranteed to amaze nature lovers.
