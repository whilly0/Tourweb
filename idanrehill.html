            Idanre town known previously as Ufe Oke is an historic town in Ondo State, and the headquarters of the Idanre 
            Local Government Area which carries its name. The town is located at the 
            foot of the scenic Idanre Hill which is of unique cultural and environmental significance,[1] 
            and attracts many tourists.
            The town is about 20 km (12 mi) southeast of the state's capital Akure, it has an area of 1,914 km2 (739 sq mi) and a population 
            of 129,024 as of the 2006 census.[6] The postal code of the area is 340.[7] Idanre is Nigeria's largest cocoa 
            producing area.[8][9][10] Idanre is mainly a Yoruba speaking tribe (Similar Ondo Dialect) with the majority 
            Into farming and trading.
            <br>
            By 8:20am we were already on a bike which would take us to the junction where cabs going directly to Ado Ekiti 
            were loading. I could tell my blood was freezing but we were already halfway into the journey. I asked Damola 
            if this was how it’s been all year and he nodded in affirmative as colder breeze rushed into my hairy nostrils.
            In a journey which took like forever, we arrived at the junction and just like we were being waited for, 
            we jumped into the rickety cab, dumping our bags in the trunk. The bike man rode away after being compensated 
            with N100.
            It was difficult but I had to say goodbye to Damola as I joined a space bus to Akure through Ikere Ekiti. 
            The journey made me part with another N800 which I didn’t regret.
            The journey to Ado took approximately 1 hour and exactly N300 per person.The journey gradually became more difficult 
            as I had to do more talking to strangers, asking for directions. The thing with solo trips is that more often, your 
            life depended more on God (if you believe one exists) and the 
            locals (whether or not you like them), hence the need for your personal relationship tools such as smiling and greeting.
            Following tons of advice from locals, I motioned a bike to take me straight to Idanre Garage where I was told 
            cabs taking travelers to Idanre hills are stationed. I was the 2nd passenger aboard the 6-sitter cab which was 
            originally designed by Toyota to carry just 4 people, but who was I to rebel against a lifelong tradition? Even 
            if I would, it would be unwise to try that several kilometers away from home. 
            Two more passengers joined before I jumped off the cab, reported myself to the driver and paid my fare (N400 ). 
            I was back 10 minutes later with two bottles of water under each armpit and a black nylon bag containing diced 
            roasted yams.

             <br> Prior to this trip, Badagry and Olumo rock have won my heart in terms of organization and attitude 
             visitors. On sighting me at the gate, the 5 of them parted their lips, letting out different shades of smile. 
             It was obvious they were all happy as I immediately 
            felt welcomed. The breeze escaping through the woods continuously attacked my face. I didn’t bother 
            restraining them.I greeted and they returned the gesture before introducing themselves on after the other. I felt 
            more pleased as I was introduced to my tour guide Mr Paul Bamigbaiye who led me to a large beautifully designed space 
            which served as the reception where I made payment after being given the breakdown. 
            It costs #1,000 for an adult and #500 for children. this is excluding the tour guide’s fee which has to be 
            negotiated.Leaving my bag behind, I held closely my bottles of water with my camera strapped round my neck while I 
            listened to the briefing of our proposed journey by Mr paul.
            My heart skipped on hearing that we have approximately 700 steps to climb before getting to the summit 
            (but with 5 resting points). That’s crazily more than that of Olumo and Ado Awaye. But hey, 
            “I’m up to the task” I said to myself, beaming a soft smile as Mr Paul summoned me to follow him.
            (IDANRE HILLS (914 METERS) WILL STILL BE TALLER THAN OLUMO ROCK (137 METERS) AND ZUMA ROCK (725 METERS) IF PUT TOGETHER).
            After taking about 20 steps, he turned to give me a warning. He had stopped smiling. <b>“Please Tunde, try as 
            much as you can not to curse anyone or think ill about anybody all through our journey as this is the only 
            forbidden act here. Instead, you should pray for those who have made you happy.”</b>
            I didn’t bother asking why because I’m more than eager to climb as I did a quick scan on my mind to see if anyone warranted a curse from me. No one, save for the Nigerian government who have done nothing really impressing to harness 
            the potentials of tourism in the country. But since they on a daily basis get cursed by other citizens, I tuned down my rage, switched 
            to my prayer mood saying stronger prayers.
            Before long, we were at the first resting point. Mr Paul said we had taken 75 steps. Though I felt we had 
            taken fewer so I decided it wasn’t time to rest. I gulped a mouthful from my bottle, offered Mr Paul some but he declined. We continued with 150 more steps to reach the 2nd resting 
            point and another 137 to get to the 3rd. I decided to rest, gulped even some more fluid and took some more 
            pictures
            </p>

            
            <br>  We soon got to the topmost part of the hills after taking 320 more steps. My legs had started to ache but 
            the views into the new Idanre town was mind-blowing as we were greeted on the left by dilapidated chalets
            which must have been deserted for a long period of time.We passed by the thunder river where Mr Paul stopped to tell
            me the story behind its name.
            According to him, there was an unusual drought in Idanre town during the war against the people of Oyo who were with 
            just one goal at the time- take over as many territories as possible. As the condition grew worse without rain, the 
            priests in conjunction with all medicine men in the land converged at that spot to say some prayers. During the course 
            of their prayers, thunder struck and it rained heavily that night so much that it flowed continuously to form the river.
            “This Thunder river also contains some magical powers such that whenever the warriors were going to war, they have to 
            drink from it and also confess their satisfaction, else, they will only go and not return from the battle. 
            We soon got to Odeoja, (the market square) passing through a path called Ese Ogbeji, meaning walking 
            side-by-side, two people cannot pass through at the same time due to its narrowness. The deep valleys on both 
            sides made it more frightening.
            The marketplace and the mausoleum where kings are buried. 25 kings have already been buried in this building. The 26th king who is currently 91 years old will after his death be buried alongside his predecessors here.
            Intrigued by the smallness of the mausoleum, I asked how 25 kings fitted well inside it. Mr Paul smiled before 
            explaining that there are numerous ways of going about the burial in Yoruba Land. One of such is by beheading and 
            splitting other body parts of the king to all 
            important parts of the land. The heads most of the times are kept in this mausoleum. I made sense out of this narrative.
            When Mr Paul announced that we had come to the end of our adventure, I was more than fulfilled as I happily descended the steps faster than I had ascended. I met other tourists who were just starting and like we normally do to ourselves,
            I encouraged them, assuring them of an adventurous climb, sharing some of my ‘agbalumo‘ with those who cared for some.
            I LEFT IDANRE HILLS VERY HAPPY AND ACCOMPLISHED AT THE SAME TIME FOR I HAD SUCCESSFULLY VISITED EVERY IMPORTANT DESTINATIONS IN SOUTHWEST NIGERIA.
