        <p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.4;"> Olumo Rock is a mountain in south-western Nigeria. It is located in the city of Abeokuta, Ogun State, and was
            normally used as a natural fortress during inter-tribal warfare in the 19th century. Its patron spirit is
            venerated in the Yoruba religion as an orisha. The name olumo is the combination of two words: "olu" which
            means god/deity, and "mo" which means moulded.
            Olumo Rock is located in the city of Abeokuta, Ogun State. Historically, the rock was a natural fortress for the 
            Egbas during inter-tribal warfare in the 19th century. It provided protection to the Egba people when they needed 
            it, and is now held in high esteem by the members of the clan. The mountain, one of the most popular 
            tourist destinations in Nigeria, sits in the heart of Abeokuta – a name which means “Under the rock” in the Yoruba 
            language. The rock has a height of 137 meters above sea level. Abeokuta was originally inhabited by the Egbas, who 
            the rock provided with sanctuary and gave a vantage point to monitor the enemy’s advance, leading to eventual 
            triumph in war. The town of Abeokuta eventually grew as these new settlers spread out from this location.

            At around 08:00am i was all ready to set out for my journey to Abeokuta in Ogun state. I board a bus in Oshodi right here in Lagos, 
            at around 08:20am the bus took to the road. The trip was meant to be maximum of 150 minutes but we spent 270 minutes due to the Lagos-Ibadan expressway traffic.
            The bus soon set me down at a place called Kuto still in Abeokuta where I took another vehicle that stopped 
            me right in front of Olumo rock. I had observed that Abeokuta itself is an ancient hilly town full of rocks. 
            This Olumo rock is incredibly wonderful. We soon struck up friendship with a 
            guide and photographer who would give us historical explanations about the rock and take several photographs 
            of us using digital camera. Our first assignment was climbing the stairs (which I understood was artificially 
            attached to the rock by the present Governor of the state, His Excellency, Otunba Gbenga Daniel popularly 
            called OGD by his political Admirers in 2006 to boost the tourist arrangement of the rock) This exercise 
            tired us out completely as we had to take a rest immediately we got to the top of veranda provided on the 
            rock with a balcony. 
            Next we were shown the "Egba town Hide-out" which obviously were tiny natural caves with holes on the floor, 
            we were told that the Egba warriors hid their wives children and in these caves while they engaged their 
            enemies in the inter-tribal wars. This war is known as the Yoruba civil war in History. The holes dug on 
            the floor were said to have provided a device for the grinding peeper, tomatoes, onions and other ingredients 
            during the war.We were also shown a tomb with an epitaph describing the name of the deceased as "Sonni" with 
            the year of his final departure in 1956. The explanation for the interment here is that in the olden times 
            the Egbas were often interred within their premises. We took note of a shrine said to be opened only once in 
            a year perhaps every August 8, when the festival in veneration of the stone god which saved the lives of the 
            Egbas is often held. We got to know that the festival itself attracts the Alake of Egbaland and several other 
            dignitaries from within and outside the town.
            We were stunned to discover some aged women still living on top of the rock. These Aged women simply said to 
            be of the "7th generation" were indeed very pleasant and nice to meet. Our next mission took us to the very 
            top of the rock. This gave us an amazing view of Abeokuta as almost every single structure in this town could 
            be seen. Prominent amongst these were the Late MKO Abiola's family house, the first mosque in Egbaland, 
            premises of a once missionary school now said to be housing part of Ogun television House, the first church 
            in Nigeria situated in Egbaland with the influence of Rev. Gollmer and Samuel Ajayi Crowther and other 
            Saro Missionaries. 
            The Ogun River from which the state itself derives its name could also be sighted amazingly flowing from afar. 
            The palace of Alake of Egbaland said to be full of historical antiquities could also be seen. 
            The total height of the rock was said to be 137 metres above the sea level and our guide pointed to a 
            particular spot which he explained was the middle of the rock, not far from this spot is a long length of 
            crack which completely splits the rock causing it to divide. According to our guide some Europeans hoping to 
            find gold invaded the rock, a strike on this middle of the rock caused blood to gush from the rock and the 
            long crack which the rock experienced. The result therefore was the death of the Europeans who died some of 
            who also fled. 
            As we climbed down this magnificent rock, Series of questions struck my memory. I was simply imagining how 
            trees which I saw on top of the rock could have grown without any access to the soil, and how the rock was 
            said to have been discovered by a Hunter. Again I imagined how a Hunter could have discovered what may have 
            been visible to everyone.
